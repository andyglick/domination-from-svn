Risk - Yura Mamyrin (yura@yura.net)

Still needs to be done:


	LOBBY:
		* map and missions dont get translated coz of the sending the game object
		* if they WERE loaded, then the ResourceBundle.getBundle may pull the whole system over

	GUI:
		make the spinners force correct entry by 1 going down when another goes up
		java.lang.StackOverflowError in windows vista, not my bug really
		in the installer it says "package.base" instead of "Risk base files"
			^ now seems fixed, but does not allow you to unselect something
		* add globe animation to applet loading, MAYBE

	CORE:

		bug report not fully working with current server
		add the new AI to the game from the masters project
		**** save should be blocked in mustmove mode after a won battle, otherwise when its loaded it crashes
		redo graph to use doubles instead of ints for scale
		should let u stop a game if it is in replay mode
		ADD continue command to Flash GUI and Swing GUI
		ADD replay to FlashGUI
		* Same time Risk - inovation (maybe)

	NETWORK:

		**** when 1 player selects a map others dont have it crashes the game, should revert to old 1
		can not leave when its not ur go
		after everyone has left server after a game, u should be able to rejoin the same server
		when people select a capital in network game other ppl can see when they select it in the console
		should be able to join a game at any stage and it should be fast

	TEXT/HELP:

		make everything that should be translated be translated
		update help files with the crads fixed thengy
		Help needs to be Finished
		make it say u can trade 3 different cards
		the console prompt is not getting the text for it from the translation file

Possible Additions: (and yuras comments)

	maybe you can add a notify sound for when its the player's turn?
	Music - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Planets#Media

	Idea:
		* If a new round starts each player who holds his own capital get's 1 or x additional armie(s) -> (fix placed at the capital) 
	Optional:
		* If you hold a capital of another player you get additional armies too -> (fix placed at the capital) 


	should let u use contry names in the console
	If the task, you have to fulfill, is coincidentally solved by another player, then you had luck and nevertheless won
	would be nice if the player knows how many cards the enemies have!

	add gpl info to about box and all the java files
	add command line options like "Risk.jar -server" or "Risk.jar test.save"
	make a map file a zip of jar file that holds all the map images and stuff
	make choosemap and choosecards drop down menus in GUIs
	Add network commands to help in commands section and add "info" command
	Help should use css

	"Attack untill defeated" option,
		untill you've won;
		untill "n" armies left;
		untill you only have "n" more armies than the defender;
	making a just-defeated country the default attacker for the next attack.
	dice roll and attack/defense statistics.

	Easter egg - cheat for good dice
	Easter egg - when u select sertain names - things happen
	Easter egg - funny cards - NO TRADE CARD

	3D circles on map
	the undo button should be disabled at the start of the players go i.e. when there is nothing to undo..?
	- put in a pause finction
	- if u win u get a sad message of game over, and the results message it crap
	-fast AI, fast dice in FlashGUI
	make the highlight fade in and out

	make it not case sensitive in the console
	Add Stats to the text console
	Yura - add a history command (if i just have way too much time)
	"New player selected: ELMEEEEEEEEER3. You have +number_of_cards+ cards, you must trade until you possess under 5 cards"
	^ somehow show trade cap and when u MUST trade
	Rolled dice... 1 armies defeated, 1 armies lost. 13 armies remain on +defendercountry 23 armies available +attackercountry+ for attack

	ADD SAVE GAME IN GAME SETUP, but \/
	GAME BUG - save game during game setup couses all kinds of problems when loading with the map images and players

GAME ENGINE ADDITIONS

	-distribute extra units option - not really needed, but other risk has it
	Naeem - in 2 player mode let the player put 2 armies down at a time
	-let the first player not be random
	-let the number of troops for a cards trade not increase or be fixed or be none
	-let u NOT get the captured cards
	-do not limmmit supply lines/no supply lines
	-support missions were u need to conquer and hold countries
	-optimise defending dice by not throwing many if the attacker has all 6
	-wait untill next go to win mission risk
	put in some sort of campagn system where u get through diferent maps with diferent set up problems that get harder and harder.
	nutral player gets reinforcments
	a option that will restrict you from rolling 2 dice if you have only 2 armies in that country (you must have 3 or moew to roll 2 when defending)
	i saw that in some risk rules you get reinforcements as seen on your card (e.g. for 3 artillery you get 3 artillery units)

NOT GOING TO DO OR NOT UNDER MY CONTROLL:

	This is a resurved file name in windows, so u can not save a file	- in any GUI when u save with the file name "con" it does not save, if text file is being saved, then in prints to the console
	?DONT CARE 1.0.7.0 - MAP BUG - You can find out other peoples risk cards by looking at the Risk card ownership view during there go
	?I will not support java 1.3 any more as it does not support the new jar files - GUI BUG - make the image loading work in java 1.3
	?FIXED in java 1.4 but still in java 1.5 - sometimes the image goes wrong when dialog boxes are opened (e.g on my laptop) - can anyone find other better ways of putting a gif into a program
	put some sort of basic chat into the network play - not needed as game is not full screen and u can use GAIM ...
	WE DID NOT CONFIRM THIS IN THE RULE BOOK				- Adrian - card trading - the rules say that a player can trade cards if the player still has armies to place at the start of the turn.
	MAYBE IF HE PUT THAT COUNTRY FIRST IN THE LIST OF CARDS TO TRADE	- let the player choose what country he gets the extra armies on when he trades cards 
	the gui will remember this						- After all countries are taken, there should be a command to view what countries the player owns (i'm assuming gui will show it though) since autoplace doesn't seem to work, i think its trying to place armys onto all 42 countries, and not randomly placing armys on what countrys the player owns. 
	use same names as in mapfile (worldmap.txt) or use the numbers		- Consider using shortened country names or how they show exactly on the map (Or show valid country names in help)






- beside a circle brush - it would be nice to have the alternative to draw lines also, because is easier then to follow borders.
- draw shape?!
- load maps from other risk game?!


- after you played a game -> when you start a new one, the adjustments will go lost (map type, # of players, etc.) It would be nice to keep the personal preferences ..

- should not see what cards other players have, but SHOULD see how many cards they have


play this game with another ruleset.

- After winning a battle you can shift only three armies into the conquered land.
In this way you can attack the next land with only two armies.
This decrease the distributionvelocity.
- Each opponent can use three dice (defender and attacker).
- In army displacement phase after the battle phase, you can shift your troups how you want.
But you con only shift troups between countries wich have a connection. Either they lies direct side by side or
the countries have a contact over own land.
- If a opponent has lost his last country, the attacker don't get the cards from the defeded player.
The released cards will be removed from the game

Could you create a section in the risk.ini, in wich I can modify my own rulesets?

Hi, your online risk game is the best I've found.

I want to propose you to add 3 (optional) rules I saw in Risk II videogame.

1) Connected Empire Bonus
Each player receives a extra bonus of armies equal to largest connected empire divided by 3.

2) a limit to reinforcements for each territory
Max reinforcement armies for each territory, every round, is equal to 2 plus 1 for each friend neighbour state a player has.

Example: if I have South Africa, Madagascar and Congo (isolated by enemy territories) I can put max 4 (2+2) reinforcement armies in South Africa, 3 (2+1) in Congo and 3 (2+1) in Madagascar.

3) In the same round, from every territory I can attack only one single enemy territory. I can't continue to attack from the territory just conquered. I can attack from others territories of mine.

Example: from the Ural I attack and conquer Siberia, but from here I can't continue to attack China or others territories (i.e. Yakutsk). Obviously I can attack China from others territories of mine (i.e. from Mongolia).

I think these are very easy to implement in the game.

What's the fixed value of cards combinations?
Thank you very much
